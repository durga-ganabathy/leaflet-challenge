To Create Earthquake Visualization

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. The dataset used for 

visualization is taken from the link- https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

. To Import and visualize the data:

. Using Leaflet, created a map that ploted all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 

. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
(The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.)

. Included popups that provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

. Created legend that provides context for the map data. 

. Leaflet color markers used : Lime, greenyellow , yellow , gold, orange, red

. Reference : Leaflet document
