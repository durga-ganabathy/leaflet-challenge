# leaflet-challenge

To Create Earthquake Visualization

. To Import and visualize the data:

. Using Leaflet, created a map that ploted all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
(The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.)

. Included popups that provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

. Created legend that provides context for the map data.
